(2) Explain types of software.
    --> the types of software:-
        -> i. system software-
            -system software is a types of computer software that acts as an interface between
            the computer hardware and application software.
            -system software refers to a type of computer software that is designed to manage and
            control the hardware and other software application on a computer system.
            -Examples of system software include operation system, device drivers, utility programs,
            and language translators.
        -> ii. application software-
            -unlike system software, which manages and controls the computer system's resources, application
            software is designed to serve the specific needs and requirements of users.
            -application software is a type of computer software that is designed to perform specific tasks of
            functions for users.
            -Examples of application software include word processors, spreadsheet programs, web browsers, 
            reservation system, video players, photo edditors, etc.
        -> iii. Programming  software-
            -programming software is a software that is programming in hardware or non-PC devices.
            -one of the key features of programming software is its real-time nature. it is often
            designed to operate in real-time environments, where it must respond quickly and accurately.
            -this type of software is often devloped using specializaed programming languages and tools.
	-> iv. Driver software-
	    - A driver in software provides a programming interface to control and manage specific lower-level interfaces that are often linked to a specific type of hardware, or othe	       r low-level service.
	-> v. Middleware-
	     - middleware is a work is same of the name like a tow object then resours is like middleware.
	     - Example. window and microsoft the mIddlware is ms morld, ms office etc..
