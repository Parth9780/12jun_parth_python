(3) What is SDLC? Explain each phase of SDLC.
    --> SDLC mening of the software devlopment life cycle. and the process is a high level 
        software creating process.
    --> sdlc is the process is a multiple phase and defrint work of phases and then create a software.
        -> 1. Communication phase:
            -In this phase requirements are gathered.
            -The problem is specified whit objectives.
            -The constraints are identified.
            -The system specification is produced from requirement analysis. this document shoud
            clearly define the product function.
        -> 2. planning phase:
            -planning is critical activity in software devlopment. it include following activities:
                -cost estimation to find best affordable cost
                -Task scheduling and timeline management
                -work organization and team structure designing
        -> 3. Modeling phase:
            -the system specification are translated into a software representation. this stage is concerned with:
                -data structure
                -software architecture
                -algorithmic detail
                -interface representation
            -hardware requirements are also specified.
        -> 4. Construction phase:
            -the implementation and testing
            -the designs are translated into the software domain
            -detailed documentation from the design phase can reduce the coding effort.
            -testing focues on making sure that errors are identified, and the software meets its requirement 
            specification
        -> 5. Deployment phase:
            -after construction software is deliverd the customer, maintenance part is largest and never ending phase.
            in this phase software is updated to:
                -meet the needs of customer.
                -change according to external environment.
                -correcting errors
                -enhancing the efficiency
