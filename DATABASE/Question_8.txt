8. What is SQL Key Constraints writing an Example of SQL Key Constraints.
-> Constraints can be specified when the table is created with the CREATE TABLE statement, or after the table is created with the ALTER TABLE statement.
-> Syntax-
	CREATE TABLE table_name (
    column1 datatype constraint,
    column2 datatype constraint,
    column3 datatype constraint,
    ....
);

->SQL constraints are used to specify rules for the data in a table.
->The following constraints are  used in SQL:

----------NOT NULL - Ensures that a column cannot have a NULL value
----------UNIQUE - Ensures that all values in a column are different
----------PRIMARY KEY - A combination of a NOT NULL and UNIQUE. Uniquely identifies each row in a table
----------FOREIGN KEY - Prevents actions that would destroy links between tables
