    A friend means so much to us. And we enjoy being with our friends. True friends are hard to come by. True friends love
    each other through thick and thin. They share with and care for each other at all times. The bond between true friends
    is so strong that it lasts through life. Having a true friend is a real gift. It is valuable like a precious jewel. And
    the friendship between true friends is always treasured and cherished.
